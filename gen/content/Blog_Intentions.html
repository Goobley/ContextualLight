**Project Intentions**

The primary motivation of this site, beyond simply cataloguing my publications and contact details, is to document interesting and/or useful information relating to my work that would otherwise "fall through the cracks".
The current climate in academia is strongly biased against publishing null results, which can frequently lead to multiple people spending significant time to arrive at the same _undocumented_ outcome.
In some instances this may make a passing comment, or a footnote, in a paper, but it is common for it to only really travel by word of mouth.
This can make efficient science very much a game of "who you know".

Whilst one blog can't effect any real cultural change (and it's hardly the first endeavour along these lines), I hope that the information contained herein will prove useful, or at least interesting in the case of trivia!

Some content that is very useful to computational physicists is also often a poor fit for traditional scientific publishing, but an online space should allow for much simpler publication of technical notes.
It is my hope that with these reduced communication barriers I will be more likely to provide descriptions of the supplemental technical information I encounter, rather than simply using it as conference trivia!
Of course, just let me know if you want extra detail on a certain topic.
