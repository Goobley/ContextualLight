    **Projects & Publications**

Here you can find a listing of my academic publications, as well as the primary projects I am working on.

I am always interested in hearing about interesting new spectroscopy projects, across all disciplines: whilst my interests lie most closely with solar NLTE atomic line spectroscopy, I find the information that can be learnt from line shapes and their associated inverse problems fascinating.

Publicly Available Talks and Seminars
========================================================================

- [**Introduction to deep learning and the RADYNVERSION model**](https://youtu.be/l8mDEDmrKgU), given at HAO/NCAR on 2019-09-30. _This was a great experience, and a wonderfully lively audience!_.
- [**Royal Astronomical Society Special Discussion Meeting: _3D Structure of the Flare Chromosphere_**](https://youtu.be/Unx6j3yuI7k?t=1762), given online on 2021-12-10, _an exciting online meeting organised by the RAS in which I got to present some upcoming work (although check my thesis for details in the meantime ðŸ‘€)_.

Active Research Projects
========================================================================

- [**_Lightweaver_**:](https://github.com/Goobley/Lightweaver) A pythonic plane-parallel and 2D NLTE radiative transfer framework for the 21st century. Due to its flexibility _Lightweaver_ is growing tendrils in many directions at the moment, being used in flare, quiet sun, and prominence modelling. The numeric core is written in relatively optimised C++, currently designed for the single shared-memory systems most researchers have access to.
- **Enabling Flare Atmospheric Diagnostics with Machine Learning**: This started with [**RADYNVERSION**](https://github.com/Goobley/Radynversion), but continues to be a very active topic, as we prepare for flare observations with unprecedented resolution over the coming solar cycle!
