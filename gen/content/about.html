**About Me**

I am a solar physicist focused on the modelling and interpretation of solar radiation, primarily spectral lines in the optical waveband.
I enjoy approaching these problems from both ends, using non-LTE radiative transfer to model synthetic spectra, and both classical and machine learning approaches to inferring the atmosphere associated with an observed spectrum.
Most of my time is spent making computers go brrr.

My focus has been primarily on flaring solar atmosphere, but I am also involved in radiative modelling of prominences, as well as shock waves in the quiet Sun.
I tend to tackle problems from a computational standpoint, building tooling to provide new angles; I strongly value clear and expressive APIs that allow users to focus on the task at hand and strive to provide this experience to other researchers.

You can often find me online under `Goobley`.

I am currently working as a PDRA at the University of Glasgow, with Prof. Lyndsay Fletcher, on _Applications of Machine Learning to Solar Flare Interpretation and Analysis_, enhancing our previous RADYNVERSION model, and increasing our diagnostic capability in preparation for the deluge of data that will be arriving from ground-based instruments over the next solar cycle.

During my [PhD](https://theses.gla.ac.uk/82584/) (working with Prof. Lyndsay Fletcher) I focused primarily on examining and extending the radiative treatment of the current generation of radiative hydrodynamic flare models using my own non-LTE radiative transfer framework [_Lightweaver_](https://github.com/Goobley/Lightweaver) (developed in collaboration with Ivan MiliÄ‡), including the Lyman lines' photoionising effects, and the effects of radiation from a plane-parallel flare model on an adjacent 2D slab of chromosphere.
I also utilised simulations from the radiation hydrodynamic code RADYN as a training set for a novel invertible neural network, allowing rapid inference of solar atmospheric properties from a flaring atmosphere for the first time.
This tool [RADYNVERSION](https://github.com/Goobley/Radynversion), removes previous constraints of time-independent atomic level populations (very important in a dynamic flaring atmosphere), and hydrostatic equilibrium (such atmospheres are far from static), and allows entire fields of view to be inverted in minutes on modest computing hardware.
